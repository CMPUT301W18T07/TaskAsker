# TaskAsker
TaskAsker is a project app made by for CMPUT 301 at the University of Alberta in Winter 2018 by Team 07.

TaskAsker intends to create a reliable marketplace for users to post tasks they need done, such as mowing the lawn or walking the dog.
Users can "bid" on these tasks for the creator to accept. The creator is able to view contact information for the provider to arrange a meeting time and place.

TaskAsker runs on Android, and is created using Android Studio. Please view the wiki for more in-depth development information.
